Hi!! Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm software developer since 2019. Currently, work with JavaScript, Python, but you'll find projects with Java, Go, Rust, and another tools in my profile too.

Here I work on personal projects, like Bookue (pinned bellow).

If you want to know more about me or my projects, send an email to contato.alexnicolas@gmail.com.
